# Software-for-Automation-of-Database-Generation-and-Data-analysis
The project aims to Automate the generation of Excel Sheet Database by use of raw data tables generated by the staff’s system and development of a tool to combine multiple year survey data and a tool to calculate the annual growth rate. The tool should also enable the development of graphs from the sheet data easily.

Phase 1:
• Development of an algorithm to convert any notepad datafile arranged randomly to its proper excel datasheet with proper alignment of data in a tabular format for further use and analysis. Further, this whole working should be GUI based.

Phase 2:
• Development of another GUI to enable user to combine any number of excel databases by giving them the independence to select the data in an arbitrary manner. The number of sheets to be combined and data selection has to be kept totally dynamic.

Phase 3:
• Development of a GUI to plot the data of any excel sheet. The plots taken in consideration are bar plots and pie charts.

Phase 4:
• Development of a GUI to facilitate the calculation of CAGR by simple selection of rows and columns.

Phase 5:
• Combine all the 4 phases into a singly handled GUI platform.
